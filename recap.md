# Starter Code Recap

Before you start on this project, let's recap a bit about how we arrived at this point.

## Function Components

In `src/components`, we have created two components:

- **Product Card**: A card that shows the product image, name, price, and a button to add the product to the cart.
- **User Table**: A table of users, with their name, email, and a button to delete the user.

Each of these is a **function component**. They are functions that return out HTML strings. Well, really, just strings, as Node has no concept of HTML.

These function components leverage **template literals** to create the HTML strings. This is a powerful feature of JavaScript that allows us to create multi-line strings with ease. We are also able to interpolate the dynamic data into the strings.

In `src/components/user/table.js`, we see the usage of a `map` method. Specifically, this component expects to receive an array of users, and it maps over that array to create a table row for each user. Whenever we are mapping over an array, we are running a âž¿, taking in each individual item in that array and returning a new item. In this case, we are returning a table row for each user.

Just for comparison, here's how that would have looked using a `for` loop:

```javascript
function UserTable({ users }) {
  let tableRows = "";
  for (let i = 0; i < users.length; i++) {
    tableRows += `
      <tr>
        <td>${users[i].name}</td>
        <td>${users[i].email}</td>
        <td><button>Delete</button></td>
      </tr>
    `;
  }

  return `
        <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Email</th>
            <th>Action</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            ${tableRows}
        </tbody>
        </table>
    `;
}
```

We can observe that using a `.map` method is much cleaner and easier to read. It also allows us to separate the logic of creating the table rows from the logic of creating the table itself.

## Utility Functions

In `src/utils.js`, we have created two utility functions:

- **`formatPrice`**: A function that takes a number and returns a string formatted as a price. For example, `formatPrice(10)` should return `"$10.00"`.
- **`calcPriceWithTax`**: A function that takes a price and a tax rate, and returns the price with tax included. For example, `calcPriceWithTax(10, 0.1)` should return `11`.

`formatPrice` was one of the few parts of the codebase that introduce something not seen before: `.toFixed`. Upon [reviewing MDN examples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed#examples), we can see that this method is used to format a number by replacing it with a string that represents the number rounded to a fixed number of decimal points, which we specify as an argument.

### Everything in JS is an Object Except Primitive Types (and even some of those can behave like objects at times)

Ordinarily, a primitive number, say `10` is fixed and immutable. It cannot 'change' into `"10"` or `"10.00"`. However, when we call a method on it, like `10.toFixed(2)`, JavaScript temporarily 'wraps' the primitive number in a `Number` object, which has a method `toFixed`. This is called **boxing**. After the method is called, the object is discarded, and we are left with the primitive number again. Yeah, it's confusing ðŸ˜•, but this will be covered again in the future.

## Your Turn

### Review Questions

To help you reflect on what you've learned so far, here are some review questions:

1. **Function Components**

   - What are the benefits of using function components in your project?
   - How do template literals enhance the readability and maintainability of your HTML strings?
   - Can you explain the difference between using a `for` loop and the `.map` method for iterating over arrays in JavaScript?

2. **Utility Functions**

   - How does the `formatPrice` function utilize the `.toFixed` method to format numbers as prices?
   - What is the purpose of the `calcPriceWithTax` function, and how does it calculate the final price?

3. **JavaScript Concepts**

   - What is the concept of **boxing** in JavaScript, and how does it apply to primitive types like numbers?
   - Can you think of other scenarios where JavaScript might temporarily convert a primitive type to an object?

4. **Project Structure**
   - Why is it beneficial to organize your components into separate directories within the `src/components` folder?
   - How does the use of `default` exports simplify the import statements in your project?

Reflecting on these questions will help solidify your understanding of the concepts and practices used in this project.
